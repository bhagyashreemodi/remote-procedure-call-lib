    A <code>Service</code> encapsulates a multithreaded TCP server and allows connections
    from client Stubs that are created using the <code>StubFactory</code>.

    The <code>Service</code> class is parametrized by a type variable. This type variable
    should be instantiated with an interface. The <code>Service</code> will accept calls
    from <code>Stubs</code> to invoke methods on this interface.  It will then forward those
    requests to an instantiated <code>Object</code>, which is specified when the <code>Service</code>
    is constructed.  The <code>Object</code> must implement the remote interface.  Each method
    in the interface should be marked as throwing <code>RemoteObjectException</code>,
    in addition to any other exceptions as needed.
    <p>
    Exceptions may occur at the top level in the listening and service threads.
    The <code>Service</code>'s response to these exceptions can be customized by deriving
    a class from <code>Service</code> and overriding <code>listen_error</code>
    or <code>service_error</code>.
